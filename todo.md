### the game idea:
- red pixel which grows pixels out of it
- blue pixel which grows pixels out of it in a different way
- yellow pixel

- they all grow out using different algorithms
- if they overlap, there is an equal chance of any of them to take the pixel over. but this should change because then nothing will happen

### TODO
- mkae it so the default color in all of the different particle type classes actually work
- i really need to get step function to work but i just cant
